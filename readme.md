### Introduction

Debugger is a spark that provides flexible debugging functionality inside CodeIgniter applications.

### Installation

First, you will need to [install the sparks package manager][]. Once this is complete, change directory to the root of your CodeIgniter application and issue the following command `php tools/spark install debugger`. You're on fire!

To load Debugger into your application use `$this->load->spark('debugger/1.0.0')`. The debugger object will now be accessible via `$this->debugger`.
